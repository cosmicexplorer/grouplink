grouplink
=========

We want to build two prototypes of a cryptosystem to support **anonymous, group-fungible identities**. *Eventually,* our goal is to additionally support **forward-secret verification** and **legacy GPG interop**. We propose to build this on top of the Signal double ratchet [^double-ratchet] and X3DH algorithms [^x3dh] as follows:
1. [*minimal:*](#minimal) use the Signal Protocol (and its constituent algorithms) unchanged, but add endpoints for creating a special new class of *group-fungible* identities.
2. [*full:*](#full) replace a Signal *UserID* with an anonymous identity, and allow all operations to be group-fungible.

The above will be implemented via a CLI tool in Rust, without any concept of a central server yet. We then would like to add:

3. [*gpg:*](#gpg) expose a group message type which creates ephemeral gpg keys for signing, encryption, and/or decryption.

We finally reconstitute this cryptosystem into a messaging system:

4. [*live:*](#live) make a server which supports our modified "grouplink" protocol.

# Minimal

- [x] **Confirmed** that the Signal Protocol itself has no dependency on a phone number, just the app.
- [ ] **TODO: WE ARE HERE** Perform a minimal enc/dec test for a buffer.
    - [ ] Remaining stores to implement:
        - [x] **`crypto_provider`**
        - [x] **`session_store`**
        - [ ] `identity_key_store`
        - [ ] `pre_key_store`
        - [ ] `sender_key_store`
        - [ ] `signed_pre_key_store`
    - [ ] Discuss memory motion through the stores a bit with `@ireneista` and co.
        - Try to agree on which actions/entities each corresponds to in the double-ratchet [^double-ratchet] or sesame [^sesame-paper] protocols.


Then, see if the following still makes sense:
- [ ] Add an "endpoint" to the Signal Protocol to create a new *group-fungible* identity, which doesn't do anything yet.
- [ ] Add corresponding endpoints for:
    - [ ] Adding another such identity to the group.
    - [ ] Sending a message *to* the group.
    - [ ] Sending a message *as* the group (hence making it "group-fungible").

## Completion Criteria
Encrypted messages can be sent between group-fungible identities in a test case.

# Full

- [ ] Modify the Signal Protocol library [^libsignal-protocol-c] to use *group-fungible* identities instead of *UserID*s.
- [ ] Make it work in a CLI tool.
    - i.e. externalize the identities and message keys into concrete files.

## Config Options
Then consider this discussion:
- [ ] Consider the **configuration options** we want to present to the user:
> @turingtarpit
> "think about whether thereâ€™s any room for letting the user configure to have degraded service in some situations for increased privacy"
> @ireneista
> there's a trade-off in terms of actually implementing it
> any time you add something the user can configure, if the setting they chose can be detected by an attacker, the attacker can use it to fingerprint them
> so we'll want to provide a minimal number of settings so as not to leak too many bits
>
> yep! 33 bits of entropy identifies anyone (because log base 2 of 8 billion is 33); we can document how much each setting leaks
> though in reality the bits leaked in theory are just an approximation, because users don't choose all possible values uniformly
> but it's still good to document so we can ballpark things

Then consider (more) our approach to elliptic curve encryption:
### Elliptic Curves
- [ ] Consider introducing elliptic curve encryption methods via libgcrypt:
> @vintroxx:
> main benefit of ECC is smaller key lengths but a lot of the curves aren't necessarily trustworthy.
> would recommend curve25519 though
>
> good resource: [^safe-curves]

## Completion Criteria
A Rust CLI tool can create and send group-fungible messages with a modified version of the Signal Protocol library.

# GPG

- [ ] Create a group message type which produces a public/private GPG key pair.
    - This should be very similar to the result of a "DH ratchet" step in the double ratchet protocol [^double-ratchet].
    - This should use `libgcrypt` [^libgcrypt].
- [ ] This should be parameterizable by sign/encrypt/decrypt.
- [ ] This should produce all necessary keys to send an encrypted message from one group to another.
- [ ] This should upload all generated public keys to a keyserver.
- [ ] This should interop with static GPG identities.

## Completion Criteria
Ephemeral GPG identities can be created and used for:
1. [ ] **forward-secret signatures**
2. [ ] **legacy GPG interop**

# Live

- [ ] Create a server implementing the above "grouplink" protocol with GPG support, either by:
    - modifying the Signal Server [^todo-signal-server-security-guarantees] to invoke the rust CLI tool.
    - *(preferred)* creating a rust server which extends the code from the CLI tool.

## Validation/Verification
- [ ] Consider whether the *Cryptol* [^cryptol] tool can validate any properties we want to validate.
- [ ] See whether eBPF could do anything like this as well.

## Completion Criteria
An arbitrary device can perform the operations of the grouplink protocol with GPG support by sending encrypted requests to an external server process.
